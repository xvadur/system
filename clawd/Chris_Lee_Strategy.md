# How to Sell AI Without Proof (Chris Lee Strategy)

https://www.loom.com/share/dab0ca16ccf64a23b18b7bff950a6c8e

This is the mini version of **How to Sell AI Without Proof**. Follow this document step by step and you can start getting replies and booked calls within 7 days. If you want the full system, join Execution Squad at https://aichrislee.com/squad

---

**Goal: Someone can follow this document alone and generate replies, booked calls, and clean decisions within 7 days.**

This is not a “learn AI” document.
This is an execution document.
If you follow the steps in order, you will create signal even without proof.

---

## Two Tracks (Pick One)

### Track A: You already have a product
You use this system to get clients for your existing product.
Rule: your offer still must end in one outcome:
- a booked call

If it cannot end in a booked call, rewrite the offer, not the funnel.

### Track B: You do not know what to sell
You sell the system itself:
- 7-Day Booking Automation System
- Booking Operations (Monthly)

If you are stuck, start with Track B. It removes decision fatigue.

---

## The Only Valid Sequence
**Sell → Build → Scale**

If you build before you sell, you are hiding.
This SOP pack is the selling layer.
Delivery and scaling come after signal.

---

## Required Tools (For AI Growth Agency)
This system scales through tools, but tools do not create leverage. Execution order does.

Minimum stack:
- **Apify** for scraping
- **Clay** for enrichment + verification + routing
- **Instantly** for sending + reply management

**Cost reality:**
- Expect **$200 to $400 per month** in tool cost once you run this properly.
- Some have free trials, some are paid.
- This is not “free AI agency.” It is a system with operating costs.

**ROI reality:**
- One client covers the entire stack.

**Rule:**
- Spend on tools only when it protects volume and deliverability.
- Never buy tools to feel productive.

---

## STEP 1 (SOP 1) Execution Lock

### Purpose
Execution Lock freezes your variables for 7 days so you stop sabotaging yourself. Most people do not fail because they lack proof. They fail because they change everything before proof can form. Execution Lock forces reality to speak.

### What this SOP prevents
- lane switching mid-week
- geography switching mid-week
- rewriting offers mid-week
- “improving” instead of sending volume
- blaming the market with an empty scoreboard

### Definition of Done
You are done with SOP 1 only when all are true:
- One local boundary is written
- One lane is selected
- Your lane passes the Lane Filter (3 out of 4)
- Your 7-day execution standard is written
- Decision Day is scheduled
- Your scoreboard exists and is ready

### Non-negotiable rules
1. **No changes for 7 days**: No lane changes. No boundary changes. No offer rewrites. No tool hopping.
2. **Numbers decide**: If it was not tracked, it did not happen.
3. **One fix per Decision Day**: You do not change three things at once and call it strategy.

---

## Step 1. Choose your Local Boundary (Local-first is mandatory)
Local is not a branding preference. It is a selling shortcut.
Local:
- reduces friction
- increases relevance
- makes listing easy
- lets you speak with certainty

### Approved boundary types
Pick the simplest option that you can explain in 3 seconds.
- One city (Example: Vancouver)
- One metro area (Example: Greater Vancouver Area)
- Two adjacent cities (Example: Burnaby + Coquitlam)

### Boundary is wrong if
- You say “anywhere”
- It takes longer than 3 seconds to explain
- You cannot visualize it on a map instantly

---

## Step 2. Pick ONE lane (selection, not invention)
You are not brainstorming niches. You are selecting something executable.

### Lane requirements (must meet all three)
1. **Listable**: If you cannot find it as a Google Maps category, do not pick it.
2. **They already value booked calls**: You are not teaching the market why leads matter.
3. **They can pay for an install**: If they are chronically price-sensitive, you will get stuck explaining.

**Lane:** ______________________

---

## Step 3. Run the Lane Filter (3 out of 4 required)

| Filter | Pass signs | Fail signs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Money** | High ticket, already spend on ads or staff | Constant bargaining, thin margins |
| **Urgency** | Empty calendar hurts this week | Long cycles, “we’re fine” |
| **Repeatable** | Similar booking flow across lane | Every business needs custom strategy |
| **Listable** | 50 businesses in 5 minutes on Maps | Hard to find, referral-only |

- **Lane Filter Score:** ____ / 4
- **Rule:** Below 3: switch lanes now.

---

## Lane Menu (defaults that usually pass)
If you are stuck, pick one of these and move.
- Dental clinics
- Chiropractors / physio
- Med spas
- Private gyms
- HVAC
- Plumbers
- Roofers
- Home renovation
- Real estate teams
- Immigration / family law

**Avoid early:**
- restaurants
- low-margin retail
- pure referral-only businesses

---

## Step 4. Write your Execution Lock statement (say it out loud)
Fill in this sentence exactly:
> “I run an AI Growth Agency and I sell the 7-Day Booking Automation System to [lane] in [local boundary] for the next 7 days, and I will not change this until Decision Day.”

If it feels boring, that is correct. Boring means stable.

---

## Step 5. Set your weekly execution standard (inputs + outcomes)
Comfort creates avoidance. You need pressure.

### Weekly input standard (locked)
- **200 verified emails per week**

### Daily pacing (simple)
- 40 per day (5 weekdays)

### Outcome targets (choose reasonable targets)
- Calls booked target: ____
- Calls taken target: ____
- Closes target: ____

**Rule:** You control inputs. You earn outcomes.

---

## Step 6. Schedule Decision Day (every 7 days)
Decision Day is the only time you can change anything.

**Decision Day steps:**
1. Read the scoreboard
2. Identify the biggest bottleneck
3. Apply one fix only
4. Lock again for the next 7 days

**Allowed changes (only one):**
- lane OR
- boundary OR
- messaging structure

Never more than one per week.

---

## Step 7. Make your scoreboard
Use Notion, Google Sheet, anything. Keep it daily.
- Date
- Emails sent
- Bounces
- Replies
- Positive replies
- Calls booked
- Calls taken
- Closes

**Rule:** Blank means not done.

---

# Offer Document Personalization
### The declaration page your outreach points to

### Purpose
Your Offer Document is not marketing copy. It is a clarity page:
- what gets installed
- what does not
- what “done” looks like in 7 days

When you have no proof, clarity is your leverage.

### Definition of Done
You are done with SOP 2 only when:
- your Offer Document exists as one shareable link
- all placeholders are replaced
- the video slot exists under the headline
- structure is unchanged

### Structure rules (do not break)
- Template swap only
- No new sections
- No reordering
- No tool mentions
- Client language only

**Client language allowed:**
- 7-Day Booking Automation System
- Booking Operations (Monthly)

**Internal language never shown:**
- SOP
- outbound
- AI Growth OS
- automations
- tool names

If they ask what it runs on: “We run it on our backend system so you don’t have to manage any tech.”
Then back to outcomes.

---

## Step 1. Build your Five Words Sheet (steal from the market)
You do not invent words. You copy the lane’s words.

**How:**
1. Search Google Maps: “[lane] [boundary]”
2. Open top 3 websites
3. Copy their language for customer, appointment, service

### Five Words Sheet (copy/paste)
`FIVE WORDS SHEET {LOCAL_BOUNDARY}: {LANE_IDENTITY}: {CUSTOMER_WORD}: {APPOINTMENT_WORD}: {SERVICE_WORD}:`

**Example:**
- {LOCAL_BOUNDARY}: Vancouver
- {LANE_IDENTITY}: HVAC companies
- {CUSTOMER_WORD}: homeowners
- {APPOINTMENT_WORD}: estimates
- {SERVICE_WORD}: installs

---

## Step 2. Paste the Offer Document template (and only replace placeholders)

### Offer Document One-Page Template (copy/paste)
**7-Day Booking Automation System for {LANE_IDENTITY} in {LOCAL_BOUNDARY}**
Turn more {CUSTOMER_WORD} into booked {APPOINTMENT_WORD} for your {SERVICE_WORD} in 7 days.

**60-second overview video:** [VIDEO LINK]

**What this is**
This is a 7-day install that fixes the booking leak most {LANE_IDENTITY} have: inquiries come in, follow-up is inconsistent, and booked {APPOINTMENT_WORD}s disappear.

**What changes in 7 days**
By Day 7, you will have:
1) A clean inquiry capture path (so leads do not get lost)
2) A follow-up system that responds fast (especially after hours)
3) A simple pipeline view so you can see what is happening
4) A booking conversion path designed to turn inquiries into booked {APPOINTMENT_WORD}s

**What we install (scope)**
We install:
- Capture and routing for inquiries (forms, missed calls, inbound channels)
- Speed-to-lead follow-up (text and email)
- Basic pipeline visibility (who is contacted, who is booked, who went cold)
- Booking conversion path (remove friction to book)

**What we do NOT do**
We do not:
- run ads
- redesign websites
- rewrite entire funnels
- build custom software
- manage the whole business

This is a focused install: capture + follow-up + booking.

**Who this is for**
This is for {LANE_IDENTITY} in {LOCAL_BOUNDARY} who want more booked {APPOINTMENT_WORD}s from the inquiries they already get.

**How it works (7-day timeline)**
Day 1: Audit current booking flow, confirm the main leak
Day 2-3: Install capture and routing
Day 4-5: Install follow-up and pipeline visibility
Day 6: Testing and QA
Day 7: Go live + handoff + next steps

**After the install (optional)**
Booking Operations (Monthly)
Ongoing monitoring, adjustments, and optimization so the system keeps performing.

**Next step**
Reply YES and I’ll send the booking link for a short fit chat.
Reply NO and I’ll close the loop.

---

## Step 3. Quick scan test (30 seconds)
A prospect should understand in 30 seconds:
- what it is
- what changes in 7 days
- what is included and excluded
- what to do next

If they cannot, you do not rewrite. You simplify the words you chose.

---

# (SOP 3) Pattern Break Video
### The 45 to 75 second asset that earns replies

### Purpose
This video is not to close. Not to explain AI. Not to teach. It exists to:
- break the “sales email” pattern
- earn a reply
- anchor your outreach to something real (your Offer Document)

### Definition of Done
You are done only when:
- one base video exists (45 to 75 seconds)
- the video link is placed into the Offer Document
- you can send it immediately when someone replies YES

### Non-negotiables
- Face is primary
- One take, no editing
- No tool names
- No “AI talk”
- Screen share 5 to 10 seconds max
- Show Offer Document only
- End with YES or NO

---

## Step 1. Lock one booking leak hypothesis for 7 days
Pick one. Do not stack.

**Common options:**
- missed calls
- slow follow-up
- after-hours leads
- no pipeline visibility
- no-shows

**Write one sentence:**
- **Leak hypothesis sentence:** ???

**Example:** “Most booked consultations disappear because follow-up happens too late, especially after hours.”

---

## Step 2. Record the base video (Tier B reusable)
You can watch my proven pattern break examples inside Execution Squad.

### Base Pattern Break Script (copy/paste)
> I’ve been looking at how most {LANE_IDENTITY} in {LOCAL_BOUNDARY} handle follow-up, and that’s where booked {APPOINTMENT_WORD}s leak. Give me 60 seconds and you can decide if this is relevant. I’m {YOUR NAME}. I’m based in {LOCAL_BOUNDARY}. I help {LANE_IDENTITY} turn more {CUSTOMER_WORD} into booked {APPOINTMENT_WORD}s without leads slipping through. The main issue I keep seeing is this: {LEAK_HYPOTHESIS_SENTENCE} That’s why I built a simple 7-Day Booking Automation System. Let me show you the one-page overview really quick. [Screen share Offer Document headline + “What changes in 7 days” for 5 to 10 seconds] If you’re open, I’d love to do a short fit chat and understand how your booking flow works right now. Reply YES and I’ll send the booking link. Reply NO and I’ll close the loop.

---

# Call OS Install
### A fit call that ends in a clean decision

### Purpose
This call is not discovery. Not consulting. Not education. It is a controlled fit call that ends in:
- Yes
- No
- Not now

### Definition of Done
You ran the call correctly if:
- you followed the call order
- you named the leak in one sentence
- you asked for a binary decision
- you did not negotiate scope
- you did not talk tools

### Call rules
- 25 to 35 minutes
- Client language only
- No tool explanations
- No scope negotiation

---

## Call Structure (fixed)
1. Frame
2. Diagnose
3. Plan
4. Decision

---

## Call Script (copy/paste)
**FRAME (3 min)** 
> "Hey [Name], appreciate you taking the time. This is a continuation of the short video I sent. I want to understand how bookings work today and see if it’s a fit to fix what we pointed out. Here’s how we’ll run this: I’ll ask a few questions about your current booking flow. Then I’ll explain what the 7-Day Booking Automation System installs. If it fits, we’ll book kickoff. If it doesn’t, I’ll tell you fast and we’ll close it clean. Sound fair? We’ve got about 30 minutes. I’ll keep it tight."

**DIAGNOSE (12 min)**
> "How are you getting most inquiries right now?"
> "Roughly how many inquiries per week?"
> "How many become booked appointments?"
> "When someone reaches out, what happens next?"
> "Who responds, and how fast?"
> "What happens if they don’t reply after the first message?"
> "Where do leads drop off most often?"
> "Do you track this or is it mostly in your head?"

**PLAN (10 min)**
> "Based on what you told me, you’re not losing because your service is bad. You’re losing because follow-up and booking isn’t consistent. The leak sounds like: [ONE SENTENCE]. The 7-Day Booking Automation System is a 7-day install that captures inquiries cleanly, follows up fast, and converts more into booked appointments. Before we talk next steps, does this solve the exact problem you want solved?"

**DECISION (5 min)**
> "Based on everything we walked through, is this a yes to move forward and book kickoff, or a no for now?"

---

## Post-call follow-up templates

### If YES
> Awesome. Here are the next steps: 1) Kickoff booked: [date/time] 2) Offer overview: {OFFER_DOC_LINK} 3) 60-second overview video: {PROOF_VIDEO_LINK} 4) What we need before kickoff: [access checklist] We start the 7-day install immediately after kickoff.

### If NOT NOW
> No problem. Let’s keep it clean. We’ll follow up on [date]. Offer overview: {OFFER_DOC_LINK} 60-second overview: {PROOF_VIDEO_LINK} If anything changes before then, reply YES and I’ll send the booking link.

### If NO
> Appreciate the reply. Sounds like it’s not a fit right now. If you ever want to revisit the booking system later, just reply and I’ll send the overview.

# SOP 5. AI Outbound Kit
### Apify → Clay → Instantly (two campaigns, two sequences)

### Purpose
Turn your Execution Lock into booked fit calls through one outbound machine. SOP 5 does not work if SOP 1 to SOP 4 are weak. Outbound scales clarity. It does not create it.

### Definition of Done
You are done with SOP 5 only when:
- you scraped a raw list
- you enriched + verified emails
- you exported Tier A and Tier B lists
- you launched two Instantly campaigns (only two)
- you set pacing to hit 200 per week
- you handle replies daily

### Weekly standard (locked)
- 200 verified emails per week
- Two sequences only
- Reply handling daily, same day
- Decision Day every 7 days

---

## Tier routing (keep it mechanical)

### Tier A (Perfect Fit)
- Video first
- 5 to 15 per week total
- If you have time, do personal videos
- If not, send the base video

### Tier B (Good Fit)
- Permission first
- Video only after they reply YES
- Used for volume

---

## Part A. Apify (Scrape)

### Step A1. Search format
- **{LANE_IDENTITY} + {LOCAL_BOUNDARY}**
- Examples: “HVAC Vancouver”, “Dental clinic Burnaby”, “Chiropractor Coquitlam”

### Step A2. How many to scrape
You want 200 verified emails, not 200 businesses.
Standard: Scrape 400 businesses for ~200 verified emails
Hard lane: scrape 600

### Step A3. Required fields
- business name
- website
- phone
- city

**Export CSV:** `{LANE}_{BOUNDARY}_RAW_{YYYY-MM-DD}.csv`

---

## Part B. Clay (Enrich + Verify + Tier)

**Core rule:** No verified email = no send.

### Step B1. Import CSV into Clay
Create a new table: `{LANE}_{BOUNDARY}_ENRICH_{YYYY-MM-DD}`

### Step B2. Normalize columns
Ensure: company_name, website, domain (extract), phone, city

### Step B3. Dedupe rules
- If domain exists: dedupe by domain
- If domain missing: dedupe by phone
- If both missing: delete row

### Step B4. Enrich emails
Use your “find email by company” step.

### Step B5. Choose your email mode
Start with one email per company. Priority: owner / founder, manager, info@, contact@

### Step B6. Verify emails
Keep only: Valid. Do not send: invalid, risky, unknown.

### Step B7. Assign Tier
Default everything to Tier B. Promote to Tier A only if it clearly can pay and move quickly.
Target: Tier A (5 to 15), Tier B (the rest to reach 200).

---

## Part C. Instantly (Send)

### Step C1. Create two campaigns only
- `{LANE} | {BOUNDARY} | Tier A`
- `{LANE} | {BOUNDARY} | Tier B`

### Step C2. Pacing
40 per day total:
- Tier A: 5 per day
- Tier B: 35 per day

### Step C3. Warm launch
Send first 20 total, then check bounce rate and early replies. If bounces are not clean, stop and fix verification.

---

## Subject Lines (fixed for the week)
**Tier A (video first):**
- “Missed inquiries - {company_name}”
- “Booking flow - {company_name}”
- “Unassigned leads detected”

**Tier B (permission first):**
- “Quick check”
- “One thing I noticed”
- “This might be nothing”

Pick one per tier per week. Rotate only on Decision Day.

---

## Tier A Sequence (video first) templates
- **TIER A EMAIL 1 (Day 1)**: Subject: Missed inquiries - {company_name}. ... [Link to video]
- **TIER A EMAIL 2 (Day 3)**: RE: ... [Link to one-page breakdown]
- **TIER A EMAIL 3 (Day 5)**: RE: ... [Short follow-up question]
- **TIER A EMAIL 4 (Day 7)**: Last note.

---

## Tier B Sequence (permission first) templates
- **TIER B EMAIL 1 (Day 1)**: Subject: Quick check. ... [Permission ask for video]
- **TIER B EMAIL 2 (Day 3)**: RE: ... [Bump]
- **TIER B EMAIL 3 (Day 5)**: RE: ... [One more ask]
- **TIER B EMAIL 4 (Day 7)**: Last note.

---

## Reply Handling OS (daily)
**Rules:** Check daily, respond same day, do not argue, do not explain tools. Your job is to book the fit call.

### Three buckets only:
1. **Interested**: Perfect. Here’s the booking link and overview.
2. **Not now**: All good. When to revisit?
3. **No**: Understood. Close loop.

---

## Decision Day Diagnosis (simple)
Use the scoreboard to find the bottleneck.
- High bounces: verification/list quality issue
- Low Tier B YES: opener or lane words issue
- Low views Tier A: subject/first lines or list quality issue
- Views but no replies: video or CTA issue
- Replies but no calls: reply speed or booking process issue
- Calls but no closes: Call OS issue

Fix one thing. Run the next week again.

---

## Quick Start (Do This Today)
1. Write your local boundary
2. Pick one lane and score it (3 out of 4)
3. Paste the Offer Document template and replace placeholders
4. Record the base Pattern Break Video
5. Scrape 40 businesses
6. Verify emails and send 10 messages today (2 Tier A, 8 Tier B)
7. Handle replies same day

---

## Final Reminder
This system is not hard. It is uncomfortable because it removes hiding places.
**You stop guessing. Numbers decide.**
