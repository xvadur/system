  "text": "evolving.ai •• Elon Musk and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are both steering students toward physics and math as A takes over more of the routine work in coding.\n  \n  Jensen Huang recently said that if he were graduating today, he would focus on physics because the future of Al will require a deep understanding of the physical world.\n  \n  Knowing how forces work, how systems behave, and how cause and effect plays out in real environments is harder for Al to replicate and will be crucial as advanced Al moves beyond software into robotics, automation, and other real-world applications.\n  \n  Musk shared a similar perspective in a separate discussion about valuable skills for the future. When Telegram CEO Pavel Durov encouraged students to \"pick math,\" Musk replied simply, \"Physics (with math).\" He has credited physics for shaping his problem-solving approach at Tesla and SpaceX, pointing out that reasoning from first principles is often more powerful than following existing methods.\n  \n  Coding still matters, but both are hinting that the next wave of opportunities will reward people who understand the systems that Al is built to navigate, model, and control.\n  \n  —-\n  \n  A toto je ďalšia odpoveď keďže ja som povedal že pre mňa je absolútne zbytočné čokoľvek sa učiť v rámci kódovania keďže moje Augmentácia spôsobuje že mám výkon ako PhD. vedieť škálovateľný aspoň tak 7 násobne čiže moja Téza o tom žeby som mal robiť svoj vlastný Research rozsiahly a robiť o tom podrobný záznam a potom to monetizovať na Tiktoku, u je správna",
