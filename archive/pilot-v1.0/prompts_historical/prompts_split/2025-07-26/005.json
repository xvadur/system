  "text": "The user took control of the virtual browser, and I need clarification on what has changed. Since the task in Retool is still incomplete, I will ask for context or run `computer.get` to check the current screen to proceed accurately.\n  \n  The page is in edit mode with a 'Product Overview' structure partially completed. I need to review sections for Web, Desktop, and other platforms to confirm the correct product listing, leads, and sub-product details as specified. I'll ensure placeholders for GitHub links and Slack channels are added, along with the necessary descriptions, tech stacks, and image sizes before finalizing.\n  \n  The scroll isn't working because it's likely that I need to scroll within the content area, not the entire page. I'll move the pointer to the central area and try scrolling again to resolve this issue.\n  \n  The user is actively working on editing a product overview page in Retool. I'll continue with customizing the page, ensuring it shows product descriptions, tech stack, Slack channels, leads, and placeholders for GitHub links. I'll verify the current state of the page and proceed with the requested modifications.\n  \n  I'll scroll down in the design area to explore more content and ensure that we can adjust or add the necessary components for Auto-Apply, interview buddy, and their respective platforms. This will allow us to complete the page with the required sections and details.\n  \n  I'm troubleshooting a scrolling issue where the page didn't move as expected. I'll focus on the central area and use the scroll wheel near the vertical edges, as the scroll bar might be inside an iFrame. I'll attempt to scroll again to see if that resolves the issue.\n  \n  I am restructuring the page to organize products into three main categories: Web Dashboard, Auto-Apply, and Interview Buddy. I'll modify existing containers to reflect the correct product names, leads, and subproducts, and ensure each product has its own layout with description, tech stack, Slack, and GitHub placeholders. The 'Desktop' section will be adjusted to 'Auto-Apply' with appropriate subproducts, and 'Interview Buddy' will be updated with its corresponding details.\n  \n  I need to rename the container's header to 'Interview Buddy' and modify the tab names. The current tabs are 'Desktop' and 'MacOS,' which I will change to 'OS' and 'MacOS.' I also plan to add a third tab for 'Chrome extension.' I'll scroll up inside the container to access the header for these edits.\n  \n  I decided to remove container4, a tabbed container, as part of restructuring the page. I'll delete it by selecting its label and pressing the Delete key. This will simplify the page design by removing unnecessary containers for each product.\n  \n  Since pressing Delete might not remove the container due to restrictions, I'll try using backspace instead. This may help to remove the container if Delete fails.\n  \n  The container has been deleted, leaving the page blank with a 'Component deleted' message. I'll scroll to the top of the page to check for any remaining containers above, ensuring nothing else was accidentally removed.\n  \n  I'll try again to drag the 'Text' component from the left area onto the canvas. I need to ensure I place it correctly in the top area, using the 'Text' component from the Commonly used list.\n  \n  —-\n  \n  co robi zatial, postupuje podla zadania?",
