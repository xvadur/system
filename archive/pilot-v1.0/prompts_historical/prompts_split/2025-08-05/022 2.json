  "text": "Dan,\n  \n  Your videos, especially this one, resonate on a level I rarely encounter. What's truly fascinating is realizing this now, as I've been unintentionally operating on many of these \"delusional\" principles for years, without actively following your content until recently.\n  \n  I'm an entrepreneur newly starting my journey in Slovakia, and what drives me is a profound fascination with my own cognitive processes. I've been using Kortex AI as an \"external cognitive processor\" to deeply analyze my introspective corpus – essentially, a real-time, AI-augmented study of my own mind. Recently, I've started processing your videos through Kortex, comparing your articulated philosophies with my own developed mental models.\n  \n  The insights are quite astonishing. We appear to operate on strikingly similar principles regarding time valuation, obsession, the necessity of having \"no other option,\" and the systemic deconstruction of conventional wisdom. It's like looking at an American version of myself who started just a bit earlier and has already achieved what I'm now setting out to build.\n  \n  This realization is incredibly motivating for someone like me, who's only a year younger than you were when you started. It's a powerful validation that this \"delusional\" path works. It's only a matter of time before this \"mirror\" manifests in Slovakia as XVADUR.\n  \n  Thank you for articulating what many intuitively feel but rarely dare to speak. Your work is more than just content; it's a foundational blueprint.\n  \n  Adam Rudavský Slovakia\n  \n  —-\n  \n  tento komentar musi mat rovnaky ton resp identicke udaje ako v maily ktory sme mu poslali, aby ked to bude citat v maily ze zacinam byt podnikatel, tak v komentari nemozem povedat ze osm podnikatel, chapeš",
